    summary: "\t\tHello, my name is Elliot. Originally from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, I moved to Canada to pursue my studies and have been living there ever since. I completed my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at the University of New Brunswick (UNB). Currently, I am working as a software developer at Siemens. \
            \
            \n\n\t\tIn my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in nature by going for walks in the park. I find it refreshing and a great way to unwind after a long day. When im not out enjoying the greenery, you can find me reading or at the gym to stay active and healthy. \
            \
            \n\n\t\tBesides that, coding is not just my profession, but also a hobby I enjoy a lot. I often spend my leisure time working on personal projects, exploring new technologies, and improving my skills. You could check out some of my projects in the 'Projects' tab above to see what I've been working on recently! \
            \
            \n\n\t\tI'm all for making new connections, whether brainstorming over a coding challenge or sharing the thrill of outdoor adventures. Feel free to drop me a line, I'm just a message away!"
