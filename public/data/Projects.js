                    It had multiple panels, and each panel served a different purpose. The \"\"Entry Label panel\"\" was responsible for adding new expenses entries. The \"\"<span className=\"italic\">Stats Panel</span>\"\" displayed a summary of my spendings for the given month. I also have donut graphs that would visualize the amount spent for each category, and calculators to distribute expenses amoung me and my roommates at that time. The \"\"<span className=\"italic\">Report Gen. Panel</span>\"\" allowed me to generate monthly reports in the form of CSV files.",

    currentVersion: "The <i>New and Improved</i> version is built on Next JS, which is a JavaScript framework that allows me to easily build web applications. This current version contains similar features, as well as additional functionalities that could not be implemented in the legacy version.",
    dashboardDesc: "I can effortlessly see my expenses categorized, allowing me to quickly determine if I have spent over my budget in any area. A comprehensive graph displays all my past recorded spendings, enabling me to see my spending habits over the months at a glance. This chart also allows me to make detailed comparisons, helping me understand my financial trends and make better-informed decisions.",
    expViewDesc: "I can effortlessly view a summary of my expenses for each month, giving me a clear overview of my spending patterns.

    musicAlgorithmsDesc: 'In this initial phase, a deep-dive research was conducted to understand the algorithmic essence in music theory. Various code models mirroring this algorithmic nature were studied, analyzing music and setting the groundwork for the creation of new melodies, such as Chords and Triads, Cadences, Musical Scales, Rythm and Time Signatures.',
    patternExtractionDesc: 'Moving on to the next section, we chose sheet music instead of sound files, in line with our main emphasis on music theory. We encoded the sheet music into \'.ABC\' format, and fed hundreds of compositions into our system, which aided in identifying recurring patterns. This data served as a fundamental resource for grasping common musical structures.',
    compositionGenDesc: 'The final stage of our project was the merging of the identified musical patterns. Utilizing our earlier developed musical algorithm models, we aimed to replicate the complex process of music composition. The integration of these patterns through our algorithms led to the creation of new, coherent songs, thus fulfilling our objective of automated music generation.',
    conclusion: 'We were able to generate unique music, which notably caught the attention of a CBC News reporter during our presentation day at the 2022 UNB Engineering Symposium. The event, which was a significant platform to showcase our project, turned more exhilarating as the reporter, amidst the attendees, took a keen interest in our work. The positive feedback we received from everyone present not only bolstered our confidence but also highlighted the impact and the potential our project holds in the intriguing intersection of music and technology.',
    finalThoughts: 'The project marked a fresh and challenging venture into the intersection of music and technology, reigniting my early acquaintance with music theory while significantly testing our programming skills and knowledge acquired from courses. It propelled us into a continuous learning journey, and opened new potential future explorations in this domain.',

    projectOutlineDesc: "The University of New Brunswick's engineering faculty needs a web-based system to monitor student progress, schedules, and enrollments using raw data from student files. Three user types will use this system: Program Advisors for creating personalized student audits and schedules, Program Coordinators for generating various student group reports and rankings, and Accreditation Coordinators for producing accreditation-related reports. Although multiple engineering programs will use the application, only one program coordinator will have access to upload the raw data. With sufficient security, students could also use the system for unofficial progress audits.",
    initPhaseDesc: "In the initial phase of our project, I was new to the realm of web development and the frameworks that were to be employed. Despite my initial unfamiliarity, I was able to contribute to the development of database models essential for data storage.

We decided to use Django as the framework since we were planning on using Python for the backend, and Django is adept at creating web apps using Python, setting a solid foundation for the subsequent phases of the project.",
    progressDesc: "As the project progressed, we unanimously chose to switch the user interface to React, anticipating a more interactive and user-centric experience. At this point, we had achieved several system requirements. Our initial demonstration went well, highlighting the basic functionalities we had accomplished. This milestone reflected our escalating proficiency and the potency of our collaborative efforts.",
    finalStretchDesc: "As the semester neared its end, we were on the brink of meeting all the outlined requirements. The system had now become adept at producing significant information for advisors, a functionality that was pivotal to the project's goals. The considerable progress we achieved was a testament to the team's hard work and unwavering commitment.",
    finalThoughts: "Reflecting on this endeavor, it was a rewarding and enjoyable project. The camaraderie and collective effort of a remarkable team made the journey worthwhile. Everyone was eager to share their knowledge, bridging the skill gap, and fostering a culture of mutual growth and accomplishment. Through this project, we not only built a functional system but also forged lasting relationships and acquired invaluable skills that would serve us well in our future endeavors.",
